BayesFlow
=========

Welcome to our BayesFlow library for efficient simulation-based Bayesian workflows!
Our library enables users to create specialized neural networks for amortized Bayesian inference,
which repay users with rapid statistical inference after a potentially longer simulation-based training phase.

    :alt: BayesFlow defines a formal workflow for data generation, neural approximation, and model criticism.

BayesFlow features four key capabilities to enhance Bayesian workflows:

1. **Amortized posterior estimation:** Train a generative network to efficiently infer full posteriors (i.e., solve the inverse problem) for all existing and future data compatible with a simulation model.
2. **Amortized likelihood estimation:** Train a generative network to efficiently emulate a simulation model (i.e., solve the forward problem) for all possible parameter configurations or interact with external probabilistic programs.
3. **Amortized model comparison:** Train a neural classifier to recognize the "best" model in a set of competing candidates or combine amortized posterior and likelihood estimation to compute Bayesian evidence and out-of-sample predictive performance.
4. **Model misspecification detection:** Ensure that the resulting posteriors are faithful approximations of the otherwise intractable target posterior, even when simulations do not perfectly represent reality.

Installation
------------

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Users (stable)

       .. code-block:: bash

          pip install bayesflow


    .. tab-item:: Developers (nightly)

       .. code-block:: bash

          pip install git+https://github.com/stefanradev93/bayesflow@Development


BayesFlow requires Python version 3.9 or later.
The installer should automatically choose the appropriate TensorFlow version depending on your operating system.
However, if the installation fails, Tensorflow and Tensorflow-Probability are likely to be the culprit,
and you might consider starting your bug hunt there.
You can find detailed installation instructions for developers :doc:`here <installation>`.
